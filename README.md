Introduction
-------------

What does it mean to be free?
Free is being able to choose. To choose your own space to be in. To form your surroundings in a way that will make you take the best out of you. Free is to say no. It is to be able to choose your limits, to stretch them to a place only you can create, and change them when you feel they no longer fit you. Free, is to say whatever you want, to whomever you want, and however you want. Free, is to know that you have a different option.
Do you know you have a different option?
Linux - Get "your" freedom
